# How to protect number from ban?

Parameters influencing number blocking resistance:

1. [Number age](#001)
2. [Response ratio](#002)
3. [STOP command](#003)
4. [Address by name](#004)
5. [Question in the first message](#005)
6. [Short messages](#006)

## 1. Number age (number warm-up) {#001}
The longer the number is registered with WhatsApp, the more resistant it is to blocking.
If you have just registered a new number, then it is the most vulnerable. You need to be especially careful during the first 10 days of the number use.
You should gradually "warm up" the number. During the first 10 days of the number use, the recommended sending volume is no more than 20 new recipients per day. 

## 2. Response ratio (incoming and outgoing messages ratio) {#002}
The ideal case is when customers send messages to you first and add you to their contacts. However, in most cases this scenario cannot be achieved. It is often required to start the dialogue first. If you send too many messages and do not receive a single reply in response, then you run the risk of getting banned. Aim for at least 30 responses from customers (30%) for every 100 messages send. In this case, with 30% of replies, it can be assumed that the number is not at risk.

## 3. STOP command {#003}
The customer always has the opportunity to ban your number if you bother them. However, if you add the phrase "_send stop to unsubscribe from our postings_" at the end of the mailing, then it will be more convenient for the client to send "stop" than send a complaint to WhatsApp. In this way you will drop out dissatisfied customers and protect your number, and at the same time boost the [response ratio](#002).

## 4. Address by name {#004}
The first contact with the customer is very important. Try to address to the customer by name. Thus you will increase the conversion of customer responses. Additionally, you make each message unique, which has a positive effect on the number blocking resistance. 

## 5. Question in the first message {#005}
In the very first message, explicitly request permission to send messages to the customer. It is important here to ensure that the customer enters into a dialogue with your number (bot) and at least replies something. This will help you achieve a good [response ratio](#002) and drop out negatively minded customers.

## 6. Short messages {#006}
Instead of one heavy message, send several small messages. This style is more like real communication than automated mailing.



# Below you can find scenarios by degree of risk to be blocked

- customers can always send "stop" to unsubscribe 

## (not recommended) Maximum risk of blocking
